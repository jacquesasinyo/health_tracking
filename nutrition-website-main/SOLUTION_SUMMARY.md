Summary of Food Image Fix:

## Issue Identified
- Food images were not displaying in the nutrition tracker
- Images existed in storage/app/public/foods directory (170+ images)
- Database had very few food items with photo paths linked

## Actions Taken

1. **Verified Storage Setup**
   - ✅ Confirmed storage/app/public/foods directory exists with 170+ images
   - ✅ Created storage symlink: php artisan storage:link
   - ✅ Verified public/storage symlink points to storage/app/public

2. **Updated Image Linking System**
   - Updated FoodImageSeeder.php to use existing storage directory
   - Created comprehensive fix_food_images.php script
   - Improved image-to-food matching algorithm using:
     * Turkish food description matching
     * English food description matching  
     * Fuzzy string matching
     * Word-based scoring system

3. **Database Updates**
   - Linked existing storage images to food database entries
   - Updated photo paths to use /storage/foods/ format
   - Ensured paths are compatible with Laravel's asset() helper

## File Structure
```
storage/app/public/foods/    (physical image storage)
public/storage/             (symlink to storage/app/public)
```

## Image Path Format
Database stores: `/storage/foods/image.jpg`
Web access: `http://localhost:8000/storage/foods/image.jpg`

## Verification Steps
1. Run: `php check_status.php` - Check current status
2. Run: `php artisan serve` - Start Laravel server  
3. Visit: `http://localhost:8000/foods` - View nutrition tracker
4. Images should now display in food cards

## Fallback Display
The Blade template includes fallback icons when images aren't available:
```php
@if($food->photo)
    <img src="{{ asset($food->photo) }}" class="card-img-top" alt="{{ $food->description }}">
@else
    <div class="card-img-top bg-light d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
        <i class="fas fa-utensils fa-3x text-muted"></i>
    </div>
@endif
```

The food images should now be visible in your nutrition tracker!
